        <p>
          I am a front end web developer with over 4 years of experience in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I graduated from DevMountain in
          2018, and have been working to improve my skills ever since.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am an avid learner, and I have always been drawn to programming as a
          form of "professional problem solving". Anything I don't
          already know, I look forward to learning. Please feel free to reach
          out if you have any questions about my skills, experience, or
          references!
